Introduction
============

The new Offwind Solver based on CFD within OpenFoam architecture is created.

There are two main folder which need to added in Open foam directory

Preparation
===========

Copy:
* "OffwindModels" folder to "OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.1.1/src"
* "OffWindSolver" folder to "OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.1.1/applications/solvers"


Compile OffwindModels
=====================

Goto "OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.1.1/src" folder.
Run command:
  wmake libso

You might have permissions issue:
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot open output file /opt/openfoam210/platforms/linuxGccDPOpt/lib/libOffwindModels.so: Permission denied

To resolve that you need to take ownership of the target folder (replace "vlad" with your name):
sudo chown vlad /opt/openfoam210/platforms/linuxGccDPOpt/lib

Compile OffWindSolver
=====================

"OffWindSolver" folder in OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.1.1/applications/solvers and issue the command "wmake", then you have OffWindSolver.
